# Advanced Governance Token Contract

## Overview

This Clarity smart contract implements a sophisticated governance token system with advanced features designed for decentralized decision-making. The contract provides functionality for token minting, transfers, proposal creation, and voting mechanisms.

## Features

### 1. Token Characteristics
- Fungible Token (ERC20-like)
- Minting with a hard cap of 1,000,000 tokens
- Controlled minting by contract owner

### 2. Governance Mechanisms
- Proposal creation by token holders
- Weighted voting based on token balance
- Prevention of double voting
- Proposal tracking and management

## Contract Components

### Key Constants
- `TOKEN-CAP`: Maximum token supply (1,000,000)
- `CONTRACT-OWNER`: The address that deployed the contract
- Error constants for various validation checks

### Data Structures
- `proposals`: Stores governance proposal details
  - Proposal ID
  - Title
  - Description
  - Votes for
  - Votes against
  - Active status

- `voter-voted`: Tracks voter participation to prevent double voting

## Main Functions

### Token Management
#### `mint(amount: uint)`
- Mints new tokens to the contract owner
- Enforces token supply cap
- Restricts minting to contract owner

#### `transfer(recipient: principal, amount: uint)`
- Transfers tokens between addresses
- Checks for sufficient balance before transfer

### Governance Functions
#### `create-proposal(title: string, description: string)`
- Allows token holders to create new governance proposals
- Requires a minimum token balance
- Generates a unique proposal ID

#### `vote(proposal-id: uint, vote-type: bool)`
- Enables token holders to vote on active proposals
- Votes are weighted by token balance
- Prevents multiple votes on the same proposal

## Usage Example

```clarity
;; Mint initial tokens
(mint u10000)

;; Create a proposal
(create-proposal "Community Upgrade" "Proposal to improve network infrastructure")

;; Cast a vote
(vote u1 true)  ;; Vote in favor of the proposal
```

## Security Considerations
- Minting is restricted to the contract owner
- Token minting has a hard cap
- Double voting is prevented
- Proposal creation requires token ownership
- Extensive error checking and validation

## Deployment Requirements
- Requires a Stacks blockchain environment
- Clarity smart contract language
- Minimum token balance for proposal creation

## Potential Improvements
- Add proposal expiration mechanism
- Implement more granular voting thresholds
- Create delegation voting functionality
